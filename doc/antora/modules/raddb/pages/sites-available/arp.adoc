= ARP Virtual Server

This is a virtual server that handles ARP.

It allows the administrator to log ARP packets on the
local network.  The idea is that the ARP packets can be
checked against a database (e.g. DHCP), or stored in
an ARP-specific database.  If something funny is
going on, it can produce syslog messages informing the
administrator.

See `arpwatch` for examples of what it should do.   For now,
this is just a toy example.

NOTE: It NEVER sends an ARP packet.



## Example configuration



## server arp { ... }

This is the default `arp` virtual server.


### listen { ... }

Please see `listen` for more.


type:: ARP is type arp.



interface:: The only configuration possible for ARP
is the name of the interface.



### arp { ... }

If you need to know the interface, use `%{listen:interface}`


== Default Configuration

```
server arp {
	listen {
		type = arp
		interface = en1
	}
	arp {
		ok
	}
}
```
